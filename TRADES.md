# Trade Log

All trades placed by `claude_code/kalshi_sports_bot.py`.
Prices are the limit-order ask price (YES bets) or `1 − bid` (NO bets).
Model estimates and Kalshi implied probabilities are percentages for the YES outcome.

> **Note on March 26 trades 2 & 3:** The daily log resets at midnight and was overwritten before model/edge data was saved. Kalshi mid is reconstructed from the settled market's `previous_yes_ask/bid`; model probability and exact fill price were not captured.

> **Strategy change — Apr 2 through Apr 6:** Switched from "fade Kalshi" to "trust Kalshi" with inverse sizing. See backtest notes in `BACKTEST_SUMMARY.md`.

> **Strategy change — Apr 7 onward:** Switching to cross-market arb (fade Kalshi). The model is now Polymarket's implied probability (+ 50% ESPN sportsbook odds when available). The bot only trades when a Polymarket market matches the game **and** the game starts within 3 hours of the run. Edge = `model_prob − kalshi_mid`; when Polymarket prices a side higher than Kalshi, buy that side. Sizing is proportional to the spread: $10 at 10pp, $20 at 20pp+. Runs every 3 hours; up to 10 trades per run.

## Notes

- **Fill status:** Orders are placed as limit orders. The bot logs `filled = 0` at placement time — actual fills depend on the Kalshi orderbook and may be partial or zero.
- **Early-season MLB (March 27, original):** The original four trades were canceled — their edges were artifacts of the 0-record clamp bug (teams with <5 games got 5%/95% model probabilities). Fixed with a `w + l >= 5` guard.
- **ATP/WTA tennis:** ESPN only exposes current rankings, not historical ones. Tennis trades carry look-ahead bias and backtest results exclude them (see `BACKTEST_SUMMARY.md`). The live bot still includes tennis markets.
- **Log persistence:** Fixed March 27 — `kalshi_trades.json` now stores all days under separate date keys and no longer resets at midnight. March 26 trade details for trades 2 & 3 are partially reconstructed from Kalshi's settled market API.
